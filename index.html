                In 2015 I graduated a technical school acquiring hotelier skills. During that time I have learnt the true value in hosting guests by taking every effort to make their stay pleasant, as well as show cordiality and warmth on each step during employee-guest interaction.
                <br>
                In 2018 I earned a BA degree in English Philology (translation with Japanese), at University of Silesia in Katowice. Those two steps in my CV shed a light on my interests, which are travelling and language learning. I find a lot of joy in comparing languages together, which leads me to the current step in my CV, which is programming.
                <br>
                What else is programming, than learning the language of machines and computers? I believe that is why I decided to pursue this career and do nothing else than learn another bunch of words and sentences! Consequently I am glad to have taken up Coders Camp course and I am looking forward to discover more!
